Version 3.4.3 - 4/23/2011
  Under Windows, allow use of the system key container for private keys.
    See -y on the server, and -m on the client and proxy for more details.
  Previously, when a client registered with a server in open group membership
    mode, it responded using the IP of the first network interface, which is
    not necessarily the interface the ANNOUNCE was received on.  The client
    now responds with a blank IP, telling the server/proxy to use the source
    IP of the incoming packet as the client's IP.
  Enabled NO_ENCRYPTION compile flag on Windows.

Version 3.4.2 - 3/29/2011
  Fixed error when passing "-Y none" to the server
  The pidfile option (-P) for the client and proxy didn't work under
    Windows.  It does now.
  Improved internal error checking.

Version 3.4.1 - 2/21/2011
  Fixed crash in Windows when receiving an empty file
  Extended the late register and late done timers to 1.5 times the old values.
    This gives clients a little extra time to send responses.
  Clients now send a COMPLETE in response to a FILEINFO for a directory or
    a symbolic link, elimitating an extra DONE/COMPLETE cycle.
  Clients may now accept a FILEINFO in lieu of a REG_CONF.  This eliminates
    a timing issue when a REG_CONF gets lost.

Version 3.4 - 12/18/2010
  Added new proxy mode: response proxy
    Used when servers have direct multicast accessability to clients, but
      response aggregation is still desired.
  Fixed overflow bug when calculating packet rate with jumbo frames.
  Fixed server bug when checking maximum size of file exclusion list.
  Fixed bug in BSD systems where setting of DSCP/TOS value failed.
  Updated documentation regarding Windows support for DSCP/TOS.

Version 3.3.3 - 11/26/2010
  Added -Q option to server, client, and proxy to specify the DSCP
    (formerly TOS) in the IP header for all outgoing packets.
  Increased max announce time and status time from 10000 to 20000 ms.

Version 3.3.2 - 10/13/2010
  Added DESTDIR option to makefile to allow installs in fake root directories.
  Fixed overflow bug with session longer than 30 minutes.
  Added examples to man pages

Version 3.3.1 - 7/18/2010
  Added -i option to server to take list of file to send.
  Added -T option to server to always print timestamps.
  Fixed bug introduced in 3.3 where a single dropped REG_CONF
    results in a client not being able to register.
  Added makefile support for Darwin/OSX.
  Improved error handling.

Version 3.3 - 7/8/2010
  Added ability to restart failed file transfers (see server -f and -F).
  Removed timeout option from proxy (-o) and client (-t)
    The server specified status_time is used instead.
  Allow proxies to keep track of multiple pending messages at once.
  Added makefile flags to compile without encryption support.
  Fixed handling of snprintf return codes under Windows.
  Have proxies foward ABORTs after local handling.

Version 3.2.1 - 6/16/2010
  Under Windows, setting the root directory of a drive (c:\, d:\, etc.) as
    the destination directory caused errors.  Fixed.
  When trying to send unicast to a client beind a NAT, the client would
    reject the transfer because the IP specified by the server doesn't
    match the client's IP.  Clients will now always accept in unicast mode.

Version 3.2 - 5/30/2010
  Fixed compile bug on OSX (cleaned up signal setup)
  Added detection of non-multicast interfaces
  Added unique ID to clients and proxies.  This allows for distinguising
    clients between different NATs that might have the same IP address.

Version 3.1 - 4/6/2010
  Added ability to send empty directories and symbolic links
    Added -l option to server to follow / not follow links
  Added -D option to server to specify destination file name
  Fixed client bug when receiving a file with the same name as an
    existing directory and vice versa

Version 3.0 - 3/11/2010
  Added SSL derived encryption.
    Uses RSA for host authentication and key exchange.
    Uses DES, Triple DES, AES-128, and AES-256 for data encryption.
  Ability to send multiple files or full directories at once.
  Clients may be listed in a file instead of the server command line.
  Added proxy daemon which allows:
    NAT traversal
    Aggregation of client responses
    Multicast tunneling
  Support for variable packet sizes.
  Removed latency levels in favor of more fine grained control.
  Support for source specific multicast.
  Protocol heavily altered to support new features.
  Code completely restructured and reformatted for ease of updates and support.

Version 2.10.3 - 1/21/2010
  Fixed ttl bug under Solaris where no value was valid
  Cleaned up handling of server timeout so an extra DONE request isn't sent
  Changed Windows sockets error messages to use proper system message strings

Version 2.10.2 - 11/3/2009
  The change in 2.10.1 that fixed the NAK issue caused a crash when sending
    or receiving empty files.  This has been fixed.
  When specifying the list of interfaces for the client to listen on, if the
    interfaces are listed by name only the first was used.  Bug fixed.
  Cleaned up more warnings on Windows

Version 2.10.1 - 8/20/2009
  Fix for last packet wait bug, introduced in 2.3
  Fix for NAKs with block counts a multiple of the section size
  Fixed ttl bug - now uses actual number instead of ascii value of the
    number.  This also results in the default ttl changing from 49 to
    the intended value of 1, so this may have an effect on existing apps.
    Thanks to Luc Tanguay for finding these bugs
  Cleaned up some warnings on Windows

Version 2.10 - 7/16/2009
  Added -B option to client and server to set UDP receive buffer size.
    Defaults to the old hardcoded value of 256K.
  Added -z option to server, which tells clients to make responses as
    small as possible.  This minimizes backtraffic when you have a
    large number of receivers.
  Adjusted timeouts to work together better.
  Server now exits if invalid hosts are specified.
  Fixed some minor logging bugs.

Version 2.9.2 - 6/20/2009
  Getting the list of network interfaces is no longer manditory.  If
    there's a problem getting the list, and you don't pass -I to the
    client, it just uses the clients hostname interface as before
  Fixed bounds checking on the server's -R and -c options, and 
    increased the maximum valid value for -c to 60000 (60 seconds).
  Fixes to run properly under FreeBSD, including:
    Use signal(2) instead of sigset(2) for signal processing
    Use getifaddrs to get list of network interfaces
    Try a smaller value for the receive buffer if the first fails

Version 2.9.1 - 6/13/2009
  Allow the full 10000 receivers for closed group membership as well as
    open.  Multiple ANNOUNCE message are now sent to accomidate the
    longer lists.
  Minor modifications to compile under OpenVMS.
  Fallback to listening on the client's hostname interface if interface
    list contains no active non-loopback interfaces.
  Got rid of debug message on startup on Windows boxes.

Version 2.9 - 6/8/2009
  After numerous complaints from Linux users, the uftpd client now listens
    for multicast traffic on all non-loopback interfaces by default.  You
    can still restrict the interfaces using the -I option.
  The -I option for both the client and server will take interface names
    (ex. eth0, bge1, etc.) as well as hostnames or IPs.
  Broke out implementations in header files into separate source files
  Commoned up all UNIX-like makefiles

Version 2.8.1 - 5/18/2009
  Pidfile option to uftpd wasn't optional as documented.  It is now.
  Fixed bug in reporting of total time.  Was previously looking for newest
    end timestamp among all receivers, now only checking completed ones.

Version 2.8 - 4/26/2009
  Functionality change: Instead of the server sending a REG_CONF separately
    to each client, it sends one listing up to 300 clients, and more if
    required.  These are sent out before each subsequent ANNOUNCE and, in
    closed group mode, after receiving REGISTERS from all clients.  The
    handling of DONE_CONF messages also changed to work in a similar manner.
    As a result, the client side timeouts were increased to handle this.
  Added -c option to uftp to explicitly set client timeouts in milliseconds
    for both REG_CONF and DONE_CONF.  Useful for when the server expects
    to hear from a large number (>100) of receivers over a low speed link,
    meaning it could take the server several seconds to process them all.
    If this value is less than the time for the specified latency level,
    it is ignored.

Version 2.7.1 - 3/31/2009
  Added -P option to uftpd to write the daemon's pid to a pidfile.
  Added latency level 4 with values 2x that of level 3.
  Fixed bug when sending DONE to over 300 clients.
  Brought man pages up to date.
  Changed license to GPLv3.

Version 2.7 - 2/26/2009
  Added -n option to uftp to prevent name lookups of clients (a similar
    option exists in uftpd).  This happens for both open group membership,
    when clients register, and for closed group membership, when names are
    specified on the command line via -H.  For the latter to take effect, -n
    must appear before -H on the command line.
  Changed name of wait variable in uftp to get around conflict on OSX/BSD,
    and added OSX/BSD makefile.  Thanks to Jusin Venus for supplying these.

Version 2.6.6 - 1/16/2009
  Fixed logging output to display correctly on 64 bit systems

Version 2.6.5 - 12/18/2008
  Cleaned up a few more warnings

Version 2.6.4 - 12/16/2008
  Cleaned up some warnings, added -Wall to linux makefile

Version 2.6.3 - 7/29/2008
  Fixed the basename function for Windows, and made a proper makefile
    for Windows.  Thanks to Amol Deshpande for providing these.
  Removed the call to basename from uftpd, since it has no effect.

Version 2.6.2 - 7/28/2008
  Cleaned up the code a bit so file names/paths have a consistent size,
    fixed bounds checking on several buffers
  In-code max of 10000 receivers for open group membership, 100 for closed

Version 2.6.1 - 6/11/2007
  Fixed wait bug in uftp

Version 2.6 - 2/25/2007
  Changed all "short", "long", and "long long" types to the
    appropriate fixed size types (16, 32, and 64, respectively) for
    better compatibility between 32 bit and 64 bit environments.
  Man pages added for Unix/Linux systems.
  The -I option to uftpd is now optional.  It defaults to the
    interface assciated with the client's hostname.

Version 2.5.3 - 10/27/2006
  In version 2.5.1, a fix was applied to uftpd to only close a file 
    if it was still open.  But apparently, the old line of code 
    that closes it outright wasn't removed (doh!).  It's gone now.

Version 2.5.2 - 10/26/2006
  Bug fixes in uftpd - the -n option was actually causing the opposite
    of the intended effect, and forgot to check for a null value from
    gethostbyaddr when looking up the sender's name.

Version 2.5.1 - 9/25/2006
  Fix in uftpd - don't close file if already closed.  On most OS's, 
    this isn't an issue, but under MS Visual Studio it caused a crash.
    Thanks to Mark Leavy for catching this one.
  Made a similar fix in uftp.  Actually, the file was never formally
    closed.  It is now.

Version 2.5 - 9/20/2006
  Allowed the -I option to uftpd to take multiple parameters separated
    by commas.  This allows you to listen for multicast traffic on
    multiple interfaces, and also allows you to receive data on one 
    interface and send responses back on another.

Version 2.4 - 9/16/2006
  Added -L option to uftp to allow output to go to a log file.  The
    default is to write to stderr.
  Modified all error routines in uftp to use logfunc.  This is how
    error logging is currently done in uftpd.

Version 2.3.1 - 7/25/2006
  Fixed to allow zero length files to be transferred.

Version 2.3 - 7/16/2006
  Fixed handling of large files in Windows
  Added descriptive error messages for Windows socket errors
  Functionality change: uftpd now runs in a single thread.  This not
    only resulted in a speed increase on most systems, but also gets
    back the functionality of receiving multiple files at once in unicast
    mode, which was lost in version 1.3.  It is also no longer necessary
    to have multiple sockets open on the same port, which caused an
    issue where multiple instances could be running on the same port.
    The code for uftpd was also restructured as a result, becoming
    more modular.
  Removed -s option from uftpd, since the conditions necessitating this
    option no longer exist.

Version 2.2 - 7/7/2006
  Added -n flag to uftpd prevent name lookups of transmitter.  This can
    eliminate issues with slow name lookups delaying registration.

Version 2.1.1 - 7/5/2006
  Fixed handling of -H option to uftp

Version 2.1 - 6/22/2006
  Made a few fixes specific to Linux machines:
  When calling select(3c) with a timeout, save off a copy of the timeout
    variable and reset it just before calling select.  This gets around
    Linux-specific behavior which modifies the timeout parameter after
    the call to indicate the amount of time left to wait.
  Added a -s option to uftpd.  Apparently, when multiple UDP sockets are 
    open on the same port in Linux, any packet arriving on this port gets 
    passed to ALL open sockets, regardless of whether or not the multicast 
    destination of the packet matches one of the multicast addresses the 
    socket is bound to.  This causes a slew of "invalid txID" or "invalid
    function: ANNOUNCE" messages that otherwise shouldn't show up.  The -s
    option will suppress these messages.  NOTE: This option should ONLY be
    used on Linux boxes (or other UNIX-like OS's that exibit this behavior),
    as it could hide a real problem.  Windows and Solaris uses should NOT
    use this option.

Version 2.0 - 5/4/2006
  UFTP now runs under Windows!  It will compile under both Visual C++ 6.0 
    and Visual Studio .NET, and run on Windows 2000/XP.  No MFC or .NET 
    functionality was employed, only straight WIN32 calls.  A few major 
    changes under the hood made it possible to have one version of the 
    code that compiles in both enivronments:
  The receiver, uftpd, now uses multiple threads instead of multiple
    processes.  This was made necessary because Windows doesn't support
    the UNIX fork function, which makes an exact copy of the calling process.
  The logging functions in uftpd had to be modified to allow for a common
    interface for UNIX and Windows boxes.  
  Changed timing routines in uftp.  Previously, the gettimeofday function was
    used to get microsecond resolution timestamps.  Since Windows doesn't have
    this function, calls to this function in addition to calculations of 
    timestamp differences were hidden away behind #defines, so that UNIX boxes
    still call gettimeofday, and Windows boxes use QueryPerformanceCounter.
  Several other functions, including perror, usleep, link, were abstracted 
    behind #defines to allow for a common interface for UNIX and Windows.
    The Windows Sleep function only has millisecond timing, however it still
    allows for proper wait times between packet transmissions.
  Wrote my own versions of getopt and basename, since they don't exist in 
    Windows.  When compliled for UNIX, the built in OS functions are used.
  Currently, the Windows version of uftpd does not put itself in the 
    background.  A Command Prompt window will remain open, even without the 
    -d option.  This was a consequence of using main instead of WinMain for 
    the entry point to keep it consistent with UNIX.  This can be worked 
    around by calling uftpd with hidedos.exe, which is a utility program 
    created by LanDesk.  This utility can be found freely on several LanDesk 
    related forums.

Version 1.4.2 - 1/24/2006
  Bug fix - missing htons() call when assigning port in uftpd. Not a big deal
    for big-endian machines, BAD for little-endian machines.

Version 1.4.1 - 1/15/2006
  Added a few missing header files

Version 1.4 - 11/16/2005
  Added support for large (>2GB) files
  On second and subsequent passes, status requests are not sent for a 
    particular section if there were no NAKs for that section.  A status
    request is always sent for the last section, however.

Version 1.3 - 9/25/2005
  Add -l flag to uftp to set a predefined latency level 1-3 
    (1=low, 2=medium, 3=high (default))
    In prior versions, during the initial handshaking and when requesting
    NAK counts, the transmitter would wait 2 and 4 seconds respectively 
    before resending a request.  This is fine for a high latency link 
    (satellite, WAN) but not a low latency link (local LAN).  This setting
    allows for shorter waits to handle a variety of network latencies. 
    This flag should be omitted for backward compatibility 
  Functionality change: The parent uftpd process no longer forwards data
    to its children.  The children now receive the data directly from the
    transmitter.  This greatly improves high end throughput.  However, doing
    so relies on a multicast feature (allowing multiple UDP sockets to listen
    on the same port) that doesn't work in unicast.  Therefore, in order
    to retain the ability to receive files via unicast, uftpd cannot receive
    files via unicast and multicast at the same time.  When a request
    for a unicast transfer is received, it is accepted only if no other
    files are being received.  The parent uftpd then handles the file 
    directly and will not accept any other files until it is done.

Version 1.2 - 9/14/2005
  Improved error handling
  Improved cross-platform compatibility

Version 1.1 - 8/15/2005
  All integers in UFTP header converted to network byte order before
    sending, and converted back upon receiving, allowing machines with 
    different hardware architechtures to communicate
  Minor performance enhancements

Version 1.0 
  Initial Release
